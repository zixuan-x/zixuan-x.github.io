As a junior engineer, there are so many ways of growth and progressiong.
You can:
- Write blogs
- Contribute to inner source
- Contribute to open source
- Do side projects

All those things are great but they are all competing for your time. As a junior you may be wondering what you should do. You may end up spending a lot of time wondering and comparing the pros and cons of each and not getting started until it's super clear which is the best option.

But oftentimes, the answer to this question is: it doesn't matter.

We often have a multi-verse world view, where each dicision we make will branch our world and can lead to totally different future and one step wrong may be the death whereas the other leads to the heaven. But that's just not sure. Sometimes different decisions lead to similar or even the same world.

The only thing that matters is that you are actually working to become a better version of yourself to learn to grow, and no matter which path you took, you end up at the same place: a better self.

Takeaway: Starting to get better now is more important than only getting better in that one specific domain that you took a long time to decide which.
