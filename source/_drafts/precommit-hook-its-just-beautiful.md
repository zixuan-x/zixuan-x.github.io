Have you ever had the experience of spending hours to fix a bug or develop a feature,
and just when it's finally done and you pushed the code, when you feel such a sense of
accomplishment and glad that you're finally done with it, suddenly an email came telling you your code failed the CI checks.

What the heck? How can it be? I though I fixed everything and all tests passed.

Well, surprise! It's the extra trailing space in a random line.

You thought, fine I'll fix it. Then you push again, and guess what? It failed again.

This time it's the missing comma in another line.

Well, I certainly have felt that frustration before.

If you are having the same issues, well, read on, let this post soothe your pain.
