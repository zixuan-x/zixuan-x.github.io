Security is hard, which is why people try to avoid it. So it's awesome that some engineer get so interested in it and take on this very hard problem.

In large corporations, we gave people very specific roles like frontend engineer, backend engineer, infra engineer, security engineers, which often creates silos and causing different groups not understanding each other. Usually, there's no clear boundaries between these (or at leaset the boundaries are much more blurred than people think), it's usually just a gradient descent.
