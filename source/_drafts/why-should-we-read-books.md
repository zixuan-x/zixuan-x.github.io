title: Why Should We Read Books (& Why Fragmented/Micro Learning doesn't work)

Premise: You want to learn

There is an abunance of ways of learning nowadays, blogs, posts, articles, YouTube videos, or even tictok shorts if you believe the concept of fragmented.micro learning.

And learning is a very hard thing to measure, maybe you learned something, but it's not immediately obvious where you can use that. So it's hard for us to assign a value for the learning we did. Therefore, we oftentimes just take the most easily quantifiable way of evaluating learning: the total time we spent on learning.

But this is an extremely misleading and awefully wrong metrics because of the following reasons: the length of learning is an aweful approximation of the quality of learning.

The quality of learning usually depends on:
- how focus you are
- how structured and connected is your learning
- the amount of distractions you have
- the quality of the learning material

I divide ways of learning mainly into two categories: books and everything else, mostly because the quality of (good) books largely exceed the quality of everything else.

The reason why book has a higher quality than everything else is that:
- books often contain wisdom and other stuff contains infomation or knowledge at best
- wisdom has a much longer half life than everything else
- a longer half life means it lasts longer and allows you to compound with it
- wisdom is about how things work and why things happen, while info is only about what happened
- Connecting dots: the compoinding of knowleage
- wisdom can be used to connect dots, infomation usually can't
