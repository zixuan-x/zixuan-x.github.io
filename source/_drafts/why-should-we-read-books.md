title: Why Should We Read Books (& Why Fragmented/Micro Learning doesn't work)

Lifelong learning is all the rage these days. Everyone's trying to squeeze in a bit of learning every day—whether it's from blogs, posts, articles, YouTube videos, or even TikTok shorts if you're into the whole fragmented/micro-learning idea.
There are even apps claiming you can "read" a whole book in just a few minutes through snippets or summaries.

But let me be real with you: most of these methods don’t work. People are mostly just lying to themselves. If you really want to learn something, the best way is still to sit down and actually read a book.

## What is Learning and Why Do We Need It

First, let's think from first principals and define what is learning and what we
want to get out of it.

## How to Measure Learning

And learning is a very hard thing to measure, maybe you learned something, but it's not immediately obvious where you can use that. So it's hard for us to assign a value for the learning we did. Therefore, we oftentimes just take the most easily quantifiable way of evaluating learning: the total time we spent on learning.

But this is an extremely misleading and awefully wrong metrics because of the following reasons: the length of learning is an aweful approximation of the quality of learning.

The quality of learning usually depends on:

- how focus you are
- how structured and connected is your learning
- the amount of distractions you have
- the quality of the learning material

I divide ways of learning mainly into two categories: books and everything else, mostly because the quality of (good) books largely exceed the quality of everything else.

The reason why book has a higher quality than everything else is that:

- books often contain wisdom and other stuff contains infomation or knowledge at best
- wisdom has a much longer half life than everything else
- a longer half life means it lasts longer and allows you to compound with it
- wisdom is about how things work and why things happen, while info is only about what happened
- Connecting dots: the compoinding of knowleage
- wisdom can be used to connect dots, infomation usually can't
