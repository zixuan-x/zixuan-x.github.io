## Hands-On

- Complete all three projects in "The Rust Programming Language" book
- [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust): practice Rust by soling 100+ coding exercises
- Learn asynchronous programming and how to use Tokio by building a [mini redis](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial)
- [PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/)
- Talent Plan
  - [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/rust/README.md):
      A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance,
      networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world Rust development subject
      matter are explored and discussed.
  - [TP 202: Distributed Systems in Rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/dss/README.md):
      Adapted from the MIT 6.824 distributed systems coursework, this course focuses on implementing important
      distributed algorithms, including the Raft consensus algorithm, and the Percolator distributed transaction
      protocol.

## Libraries & Frameworks to Check Out

- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/): a web framework for Rust that makes it simple to write fast, secure web applications
  without sacrificing flexibility, usability, or type safety
